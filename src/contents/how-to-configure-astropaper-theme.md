I'm truly grateful for the adventures that my career has given me. Most recently, I met communications professionals from the Government at a course in Sarawak.

Not only have I learned so much from the course, I've met a bunch of passionate folks who are working for the betterment of the country.

I feel honoured to be part of this group, lending my skills to help Malaysia move forward!

_PS: The date of this post is an estimate - I've transferred this little post from Linkedin and it doesn't give us the precise date. Sigh!_
